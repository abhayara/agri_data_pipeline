# Agricultural Data Pipeline Upgrade Notes

## Overview of Changes

This document outlines the major improvements and fixes made to the Agricultural Data Pipeline project.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Kafka Connection Issues Fixed

- Changed Kafka listener configuration to use `0.0.0.0` instead of specific hostname
- Implemented automatic detection and configuration of broker IP addresses
- Added robust error handling and retry logic in producer/consumer code
- Updated connection parameters for better stability

### 2. GCS Region Configuration

- Changed GCS bucket region from default (US) to `asia-south1`
- Added environment variable `GCP_LOCATION` to control region settings
- Updated consumer code to properly use the specified region

### 3. Network Configuration

- Added automatic IP address detection and configuration
- Fixed Docker network configuration to ensure proper container communication
- Implemented hostname resolution verification

### 4. Automation and Tooling

- Enhanced `commands.sh` with comprehensive functions for all operations
- Created automatic Git checkpoint system to preserve good states
- Added environment validation and auto-configuration
- Created a rebuild script for one-command setup

### 5. Debugging and Troubleshooting

- Added network tools to container images for easier debugging
- Improved log output for better troubleshooting
- Added status function to quickly check system health

### 6. Documentation

- Updated README with clear instructions
- Added help command that explains all available functions
- Created upgrade notes to document changes

## April 2025 Updates

### GCS Connector Configuration Automation

The batch pipeline has been improved with automated Google Cloud Storage (GCS) connector configuration for Spark jobs. This includes:

1. **Auto-detection and configuration** - The system now automatically detects if the GCS connector is properly configured and fixes any issues.

2. **Dependency management** - Added proper dependencies for the GCS connector and resolved Guava version conflicts that were causing errors.

3. **Filesystem implementation** - Added required configuration for GCS filesystem implementation classes.

4. **Credentials management** - Automated the process of copying GCP credentials to the necessary locations.

5. **Type handling improvement** - Fixed type mismatch issues in the data generation process, ensuring proper float/int handling.

### Commands and Scripts Updates

1. Added new function `check_fix_gcs_config` to `commands.sh` that handles all GCS connector configuration needs.

2. Updated `verify-spark` function to include GCS connector verification.

3. Updated `check-environment` function to ensure GCP credentials are copied to all necessary locations.

4. Updated `start-batch-pipeline` function to ensure GCS configuration is correct before running the pipeline.

5. Updated `rebuild.sh` to include GCS connector checks during the rebuild process.

### Documentation

1. Added comprehensive documentation about the GCS connector configuration in the README.md.

2. Added new section in UPGRADE_NOTES.md (this file) detailing the changes.

All these improvements ensure that the batch pipeline can reliably read from and write to Google Cloud Storage, which is essential for the proper functioning of the data lake architecture.

## Potential Future Improvements

1. Implement monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
2. Add auto-scaling for Kafka and Spark components
3. Implement end-to-end testing framework
4. Set up automatic backup and restore functions
5. Add automatic log rotation and archiving

## Notes on Data Migration

The existing data in US-based GCS buckets will not automatically migrate to `asia-south1`. If you need to migrate existing data:

1. Use gsutil to copy data between buckets
2. Verify data integrity after migration
3. Remove old buckets once migration is confirmed

## Rollback Instructions

If issues occur with the upgraded system:

1. Use git to revert to previous checkpoints: `git log` to find commits, then `git revert` as needed
2. The rebuild script can be used to recreate the entire environment after reverting
